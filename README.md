# Project-1
Pandas Project
Proposal

We are trying to assess the perfromance of Stocks of 4 major sectors - Pharmaceuticals , Consumer Goods, Automobile Industries 
and Technology during the global pandemic and trying to analyse which segment(s) of the markets performed better during this
unprecedented time .
And once we arrive at a finding we want to indicate that which sector gave better returns to investor on their investment or
rather a portfolio mix .
This would also serve as a reference or indicator to market behaviour for future investments.
